# People Finder

To run: npm start

You're to build a person finder! The page will show a list of people (a name, avatar and description) and the user should be able to scroll the page and down the **entire** list of filtered (if applied) people. On load, the page should be able to scroll the 3000 people.

The search box allows the user to live filter out the list by the `name` property. There are no API calls that need to be made to fetch the data. Use the mock data below and do all of the filtering client-side.
